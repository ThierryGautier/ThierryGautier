- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThierryGautier
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded software (small:baremetal and big:linux)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux on odroid-N2+ board with opencv, motion control.
I try to developp a small robot in LEGO using FRDM_KV31 board and odroid-N2+ board. 
This robot is able to:
- move with two DC motors (LEGO) 
- localisation with sensor fusion stack, acceleration(Gx, Gy, Gz) orientation( roll, pitch, compass)
- see with opencv stack
- hear 
- speak with espeak tool
- be controlled with bluetooth gamepad

I learn a lot of things during this developpement.
